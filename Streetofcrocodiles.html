                This was one of my first year projects at Ulster University. In which we were to design a one page
                website
                for the book, The street of crocodiles. I spent about a month and a half developing and coding the
                website. I’m very happy with the end result, I took inspiration from Neo-Romanticism and Kurt Cobain’s
                artwork
            </p>
            <p class="case-copy">
                The street of crocodiles is about Bruno Schulz’s boyhood memories and memories from his merchant
                family’s life. Bruno talks about his father a crazy shopkeeper who imports rare birds’ eggs to hatch in
                his attic. Believes tailors’ dummies should be treated like people. Has a fear of cockroaches which in
                the end caused
                his father to resemble one. In the book his father becomes a heretic prophet, a magician and a
                trickster. Bruno
                Schulz was a Polish and Jewish person who was killed by the Nazis in 1942. he was considered to be the
                leading polish writer between the two world wars. This book brings together his complete fiction. The
                book showcases the surrealist vision of one of the twentieth century’s most gifted writers.

                So I, of course wanted to meet that vision, I did a lot of research and connected a lot of dots.
                Specifically the Kurt Cobain side, This book was made into a movie which I researched and it apparently
                was one of Kurt's favourites, which allowed me to connect to a grunge aesthetic for the design.

                Some Issues I faced during this project was figuring out grids and layouts in CSS. Including responsive
                design, something I had not considered while coding at the start. But working through it and watching
                several tutorials and spending late nights coding. I managed to create something I’m particularly
                pleased with. I learned how to code with this project, learning HTML & CSS. It was a great project for
                semester one and It made me love coding.
