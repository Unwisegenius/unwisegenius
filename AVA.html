                For this project I had to create an app for a smart-watch. The brief was open meaning your app could be
                your own. I had the idea of creating an assistant on your watch, like JARVIS from Iron Man. But there
                two constraints with this project. 1. It's constrained to a 44mm screen 2. There was three weeks to do
                the entire project. Not ideal, but I powered through and I have created something strong.

                The project took inspiration from Balatro, a popular card game online. Which has a nice background
                shader which I incorporated into my own design. Whilst of course making it my own. My main focus of the
                project was to make it more efficient for the user. I wanted the user to drive their car and use their
                watch to play their favourite podcast. I wanted the user to ask their watch a question and get an answer
                mid debate with someone. I wanted the user to get help from a mini assistant with greater efficiency.

                The timing of the project was hard, with only three weeks to make something I got started. I put in the
                hours for this project, and I'm pleased with how it turned out. I also faced some issues with the
                critique, I wasn't happy with the feedback. It wasn't that it was bad, it was due to some technical
                issues and the lack of elaboration with some of it. But I took a day, read over it and took it into
                strong consideration, changing some major screens in the process. All this helped the project to be
                better, and I'm glad I came back with a more positive mindset. In conclusion, I enjoyed this project and
                it warmed me up for my second year of university. If you would like to read more
