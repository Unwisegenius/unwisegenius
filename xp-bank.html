            <p class="case-copy">
                XP Bank was one of my projects at Ulster, in which we had to create a set of brand guidelines for a
                bank. It was to appeal to younger people aged around 16-25. I used it to create an app and website. This
                project helped me to understand branding and learn how to install design. I created a 55 page guideline,
                a design system, 11 screens for the mobile app and 4 pages of a website
            </p>
            <p class="case-copy">
                I loved doing this project, I was passionate and wanted to push it as much as I could. I did this by creating a design system on top of my brand guidelines and pushed for detail. The design, tone of voice, in-app features, and brand ethics was to appeal to the younger audience.
            </p>
            <p class="case-copy">
                I had my setbacks with this project, the biggest one was finding the design. It took a while and many
                iterations of ideas and design. The first draft was to create a design based on cyberpunk, but it
                complicated, so I scraped. I went more in to brutalist design and it worked better due to it's
                simplicity. I kept feedback in mind when doing this project, as I received a lot I learned more on how
                to take it constructively. Rather than critically.
            </p>
            <p class="case-copy">
                I pushed myself to create the best bank brand I could. if I were to develop it any further I would have
                to actually open the bank itself. I had my challenges but I also had my agreements with the project and
                I’ve worked through them to do the best I can. I love branding projects like this because there it is
                limitless with what you can do.
