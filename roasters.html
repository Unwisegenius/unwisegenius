                This was a little mini project I set myself for fun and to explore more branding during the summer. I made Chat GPT create the brief for me as I wanted to simulate the project as if it were a real coffee chain. I took inspiration from the Helwit design style. Which contained monospace typography and dark neon colours

                The brief was to create a brand identity for a fake coffee company set in Belfast. While also designing some products that would showcase the brand.  I researched by visiting several coffee shops & restaurants. Places like Bunsen who use the business card menu which is slick, minimal and effective. Fidela Coffee for having their own ground coffee with it’s own brand on it. Follow Coffee, for a bold bright design that stands out.

                I learned a lot more about branding, all it takes is to have a solid idea and finding the best way to present that. You’ll notice that there is a lot of mock-ups in this project. Which was to push the idea that this is a real location. I wanted it to look legit. My favourite parts of this project was the coffee holder, the menu and the coffee grounds packaging. I gave myself two weeks to do this project and I’m very pleased with it!
