                Based off of Twin Peaks design. Flik Multiplex was another mini summer project I did. To showcase
                different aspects of design like web, branding and merchandising. The design is based off the red room
                in twin peaks. due to the surrealist design which I felt worked well for a classic cinema design.
            </p>
            <p class="case-copy">
                I struggled with finding the design, I nearly went for a more brutalist design, which dull colours. This
                would've given a depressing atmosphere. Something that wouldn't work at all for the theatrics. So I
                looked at film and media and I found myself inspired by David Lynch and Twin Peaks. The surrealist
                design helped captivate the feeling of grandeur that a classic cinema provides.

                I enjoyed the experimentation with this project. Making a movie quote poster was a fun side activity. if
                I were to develop this project more, I would’ve included more screens. A mobile app and some more
                merchandising.
