        <p>
          I’m an ambitious UX design student currently seeking a role in a design team who has a passion for user
          interaction and branding. My goals are to innovate with my work and be a part of an organisation that
          prioritises creativity and innovation. I also want to gain experience for the future. Apart from designing,
          I love to research current design trends and spend a lot of my time in digital spaces. As well as having a
          good cup of coffee.

          <p>
            I want to push my designs to the best version they can be—and to learn something new from each project
            I work on.
